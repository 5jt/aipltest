This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## CRITICAL: Test integrity rules

**NEVER MODIFY TESTS TO MAKE THEM PASS - unless tests are provably broken.**

### Ironclad test integrity rules:

1. **Tests are sacred**: Tests define the expected behavior. If a test fails, the code is wrong, not the test.

2. **Only three valid reasons to change a test**:
   - **Provably incorrect logic**: The test itself contains a mathematical or logical error
   - **Invalid assumptions**: The test assumes behavior that contradicts the specification
   - **Typos/syntax errors**: Clear mistakes in test code (like wrong variable names)

3. **Required evidence for test changes**:
   - **Written justification**: Must document exactly what was wrong with the original test
   - **Reference to specification**: Show how the test contradicts documented behavior
   - **Alternative verification**: Demonstrate the correct behavior through independent means

4. **Forbidden "fixes"**:
   - Changing expected values because they don't match actual output
   - Reducing test scope because full test fails
   - Simplifying test cases because they're "too complex"
   - Removing assertions because they fail
   - Making tests "more realistic" when they expose bugs

5. **Mandatory process when tests fail**:
   - **Step 1**: Assume the test is correct and the implementation is wrong
   - **Step 2**: Investigate why the implementation doesn't meet the test's expectations
   - **Step 3**: Fix the implementation to satisfy the test
   - **Step 4**: Only if Step 3 is impossible, then question if the test is wrong
   - **Step 5**: If changing a test, require explicit approval with written justification

### Red-Flag phrases that should trigger immediate stop:
- "Let me simplify this test..."
- "This test is too complex, let me make it more realistic..."
- "The test expects X but that's not how it actually works..."
- "Let me adjust the expected values..."
- "This test is causing issues, let me fix it..."

### Correct mindset:
- **Tests are the specification in executable form**
- **Failing tests reveal implementation gaps, not test problems**
- **Complex tests often catch the most important bugs**
- **Test failures are valuable information about what needs to be built**


## Implementation guidelines

### Project rules
1. **No workarounds** - Fix root causes, not symptoms
2. **CRITICAL: All imports at file top** - NO conditional imports anywhere, including tests. Import everything needed upfront, fail fast on missing dependencies
3. **No backwards compatibility** - Focus on clean design for new features
4. **No backup files** - Git handles versioning, no suffixes or backup copies
5. **Direct communication** - No unnecessary affirmations or compliments
6. **Frequent commits** - Commit working code frequently, small logical changes
7. **No regressions** - all existing tests must pass
8. **Typography** – as in this document, set all headings in sentence case: capitalise only proper nouns and acronyms, e.g. Dyalog APL

### When adding new features
1. Keep files small and single-purpose
2. Expose stable function signatures in skeletons
3. Always include unit tests alongside code changes

### Array Notation syntax

**CRITICAL: Array Notation `[...]` uses row-major order**

The `⋄` separator divides **rows**, not columns. Each segment between `⋄` separators is a complete row.

**Correct** (row-major):
```apl
['Bob' 21 'blue' ⋄ 'Ted' 32 'green' ⋄ 'Carol' 43 'brown']
⍝ Row 1: Bob, 21, blue
⍝ Row 2: Ted, 32, green
⍝ Row 3: Carol, 43, brown
```

**Incorrect** (column-major - DO NOT USE):
```apl
['Bob' 'Ted' 'Carol' ⋄ 21 32 43 ⋄ 'blue' 'green' 'brown']
⍝ This is WRONG - treats data as columns
```

**Newlines separate rows; single-element rows need parentheses**:

In Array Notation, both `⋄` and newlines can separate rows. For single-element rows, both parentheses and diamonds are required to prevent treating elements as a stranded vector:

```apl
⍝ WRONG - creates a 3×5 char matrix, not a 3×1 string matrix:
[
 'Bob'
 'Ted'
 'Carol'
]

⍝ CORRECT - creates a 3×1 string matrix:
[
 ('Bob' ⋄)
 ('Ted' ⋄)
 ('Carol' ⋄)
]

⍝ Multi-element rows need neither parentheses nor diamonds (strand forms the row):
[
 'Bob' 21
 'Ted' 32
]
⍝ This correctly creates a 2×2 matrix
```

This applies to:
- Table values: `(['Bob' 21 'blue' ⋄ ...] ⋄ 'name' 'age' 'eye')`
- Xref values: `([21 'blue' ⋄ 32 'green'] ⋄ ...)`
- Any matrix literal using Array Notation

When writing or reviewing tests, documentation, or code with matrices in Array Notation, always verify row-major order is used.

### Process
- Don't back files up by copying! We use git for versioning.
- For each new development stage, create a new git branch first.
- We practice TDD:
    - write tests first that demonstrate the desired behaviour
    - **pause for human review of the tests**
    - progress the implementation until the tests succeed.
    - NEVER tweak a test to "fit" the behaviour, unless the test is demonstrably broken.
- Maintain progress in docs/TODO.md
- NEVER EVER CHANGE THE DEFAULT BRANCH ON GIT OR GITHUB!
- When creating PRs or commits, DO NOT mention Claude, Anthropic, or AI assistance in the message
- NEVER use `--no-verify` when committing! Always let pre-commit hooks run and fix any issues they find

### GitHub issue workflow

In any Git and GitHub messaging (commit messages, PR messages, issues, comments etc), we maintain a terse, professional tone:

1. **Never make unproven claims**: don't make claims about the validity, effectiveness or awesomeness of your changes in a commit or message. By definition, that is determined by the CI results, which you can't see yet. Explain what was done, and why.
2. **Never use emoji symbols**: we're not 14-year-olds on Instagram here. No green ticks, no red crosses, no smileys, no symbols.
3. **Brevity**: issues and commit messages are written for co-workers. Respect their time. Obviously, be complete, but express yourself in a professional, concise tone.

Follow this process for each GitHub issue:

1. **Pick an issue** - Note its ID number
2. **Create branch** - Name format: `{ID}-{slug-derived-from-issue-title}`
   - Example: `9-parser-grammar-basic-terms`
3. **Write tests FIRST** - STOP after writing tests for human review
4. **Commit approved tests** - Only after review approval
5. **Implement until tests pass** - Make the tests green
6. **Run complete test suite** - No regressions tolerated!
7. **Create PR** - Make an orderly PR, squashing commits if necessary. DON'T  mention Claude or AI in the PR message
8. **Verify CI** - Ensure all CI tests pass fully
9. **Await PR review** - Wait for human review
10. **Merge and update** - After approval, merge PR and update the epic
- Don't use /tmp and other locations outside the current repository
- You MUST stop for reviews before ANY implementation
